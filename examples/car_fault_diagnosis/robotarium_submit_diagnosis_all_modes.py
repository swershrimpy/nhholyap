"""
Robotarium SUBMISSION script: single-robot, single-submission demonstration
of ALL THREE fault hypotheses (Nominal / Actuator Fault / Sensor Fault) for
ONE car_fault_diagnosis config, run back-to-back in one Robotarium session.
Between modes the robot is physically DRIVEN back to the original start
pose (a real robot cannot be teleported/reset in software -- see "Reset
between modes" below), then the next mode's u_opt is played and checked.

Supersedes robotarium_submit_diagnosis_demo.py's TRUE_MODE-switch-and-
resubmit-3-times workflow: that script needed 3 separate submissions (one
per TRUE_MODE) for the same config. This script needs exactly ONE
submission to demonstrate all 3 modes for config_idx=32. One config per
submission still holds -- to demo a DIFFERENT config, regenerate the
embedded constants below (see "Regenerating the embedded constants") and
submit this file again.

Files needed for this submission: THIS FILE ONLY. All project-specific
data (u_opt, x0, alpha range, sensor transform, the 3 reachable tubes) is
precomputed offline and embedded below as plain numpy arrays -- no jax/
immrax/car_separating_input.py import, since the Robotarium submission
environment cannot be assumed to have those installed, only `rps` + numpy
+ matplotlib (see robotarium_submit_diagnosis_demo.py's module docstring
for the same reasoning; unchanged here).

Structural precedent: this machine's existing Robotarium-submittable
examples (~/output_feedback/robotarium_python_simulator/rps/examples/
fault_diagnosis/uni_afd.py) and the go-to-pose precedent (rps/examples/
plotting/uni_go_to_pose_hybrid_with_plotting.py, for the reset routine).

Reset between modes
---------------------
A real robot cannot be reset in software -- "resetting to the original
initial state" means physically DRIVING it back to X0_CENTER's full pose
(position AND orientation; the tubes below assume that exact starting
phi). Done with rps.utilities.controllers.create_hybrid_unicycle_pose_
controller (drives straight to the target position, then rotates to the
target heading) plus rps.utilities.misc.at_pose to detect arrival, capped
at RESET_MAX_ITERS iterations as a safety net (prints a warning and moves
on rather than looping forever if convergence is slower than expected).
No unicycle_barrier_certificate wraps the reset drive -- see the comment
above the Robotarium constructor call for why one was tried and then
removed (it actively caused hardware-limit violations for N=1, not a
harmless no-op). The u_opt PLAYBACK phases are likewise unwrapped, for
the more basic reason that wrapping them would alter the exact commanded
values the embedded reachable tubes were computed for.

Three bugs were found and fixed while building this reset routine, each
caught by dry-running this exact script against the local
rps.robotarium.Robotarium simulator, not by inspection:
1. X0_CENTER.reshape(3,1) is a VIEW, and Robotarium's constructor does
   self.poses = self.initial_conditions with no copy, then mutates
   self.poses in place every step() -- an uncopied view silently
   corrupted X0_CENTER itself as the robot moved, so every reset's
   target_pose was actually just the robot's current (already-drifted)
   pose. Fixed with .copy() at both use sites.
2. create_hybrid_unicycle_pose_controller's "stop translating" check is
   `norm_ > (position_error - position_epsilon)`; its default
   position_epsilon=0.03 combined with a tighter position_error=0.02 (not
   also overriding position_epsilon) made that threshold negative, so it
   was always true and the controller got stuck translating forever,
   never entering its rotate-to-heading phase. Fixed by keeping
   RESET_POSITION_EPSILON strictly less than RESET_POSITION_ERROR.
3. The controller's rotate-in-place phase computes
   dxu[1,i]=angular_velocity_gain*wrapped with NO clamp to its own
   angular_velocity_limit parameter (that limit only applies inside the
   translate phase's si_to_uni_dyn conversion) -- with the library's
   default gain=2 and a worst-case heading error of pi, commanded omega
   could reach ~6.28 rad/s against real hardware's ~3.64 rad/s limit.
   Fixed by lowering RESET_ANGULAR_VELOCITY_GAIN so gain*pi stays under
   the limit with margin.

Fault emulation on real hardware (see robotarium_submit_diagnosis_demo.py
for the full derivation -- unchanged here): CarNomActSystem's fault model
is phi_dot = ALPHA*omega -- alpha scales STEERING (omega), not throttle
(v). So "Actuator Fault" sends v_opt unchanged and ALPHA_TRUE*omega_opt;
"Sensor Fault" sends u_opt unchanged and instead transforms the RECORDED
pose (obs_scale*[px,py] + obs_offset) before checking it against the
tubes -- the robot's true motion is identical to Nominal.

Config selection: config_idx=32 from success_rate_data_early_stop_
multistep_refined.npz -- see robotarium_submit_diagnosis_demo.py's module
docstring "Config selection" for why (satisfies real hardware velocity
limits with margin, stays well inside the arena, alpha range gives a
visibly partial, not zero, actuator-fault motion).
